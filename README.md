## Overview

This code utilizes the [openpyxl](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library to automate operations on Excel sheets.

The python file is commented to describe the overall processes occurring, but the main function is to simplify the data in one excel sheet and pass part of the information to another existing excel sheet.

The file itself is not very scalable although the code can be used with excel automation in other cases if the file names and specific columns being used are changed to reflect the need.

# Setup

I recommend creating and activating a virtual environment.

Install the necessary libraries (or library) by running pip install -r requirements.txt in the terminal.
